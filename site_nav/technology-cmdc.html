	<p><strong>Centrally Managed Digital Currency - $CMDC</strong><br>
	A digital currency and asset class, built on Gobble Chain private blockchain technology.</p>

<br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><b>Centrally Managed Digital Currency</b> is stylized as <b>$CMDC</b>.</div></font><br>
	
	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">A framework for $CMDC was developed in 2020. It is a prototype digital currency and asset class 
	with a specification which pegs $CMDC to a defined existing currency to determine its value. Due to the way it was developed, it was inherently flawed. The 
	original value rate was proposed to be 1:1.25. For example, 1 US dollar would equate to 1.25 $CMDC. However, big development changes to the mining process 
	altered the original proposed value rate and it was adapted to 1:2500.</div></font><br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Bitcoin is infamous for being energy and resource intensive during the mining process. Some 
	analysts speculated that its high rate of energy use could see its eventual demise. $CMDC has been designed specifically to be light on system resources for 
	both mining and data storage. This helps increase energy efficiency and ease the data storage burden, while being able to mine large amounts. During the mining 
	process, it may push all cores of the central processing unit(s) to maximum capacity, but memory usage remains moderate. While there is no technical limitation 
	to the total number of $CMDC blocks that can be put into circulation, there are restrictions on the amount of available blocks in holding, in the social 
	distribution vaults. This is a necessary component for maintaining centralized management of $CMDC and its assets. Currently, there is an imposed limit of 1 
	trillion $CMDC, per social distribution vault, spread across a maximum of 4 vaults.</div></font><br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">$CMDC is mined using a parallel processing and file duplication combination, designed specifically 
	to operate on Linux-based operating systems. Mined blocks are 'created' from a raw source block, called "block0". To prevent fraudulent duplication of blocks, 
	each individual block is dated and timestamped, and cannot be altered through traditional file duplication methods of the operating system. Once the mining 
	process is complete, mined blocks are then refined. Without being refined, the blocks are worthless. During the refining process, the blocks are compressed, 
	encrypted, and digitally signed with a unique and secret key which is not made public. It is this secret key which is used to identify authenticity of $CMDC 
	block sets.</div></font><br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Once blocks have been mined, refined, encrypted, digitally signed and verified, they are 
	moved into a social distribution vault for storage and circulation. $CMDC is built on Gobble Chain private blockchain technology. In March 2022, Gobble Chain 
	received its first major upgrade, version 2.0.</div></font><br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">In April 2022, we introduced three new tokens (assets) - C3CT Token, POWER8 Token and TIDEIN Token. 
	Token assets are now fully integrated into $CMDC and Gobble Chain. Token assets are mined and refined through a similar process to that of $CMDC blocks, but 
	have multiple layers of encryption and use a different verification method to include a unique tokenID. Token assets are valued differently and are limited in 
	supply.</div></font><br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%">Future upgrades of $CMDC will include integrated support for non-fungible 
<!-- do not use tab in front of <span>. keep level with line start margin -->
tokens<span title="A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded.

	<!-- return to normal line formatting -->	
	The specification for NFT integration with Gobble Chain private blockchain technology is yet to be finalized and more information will be provided when 
	available. When supported, NFT integration will provide the option for rights holders of digital images, audio, video and other digital artwork 
	creations, to sell the rights to their original creations, as NFTs, which will be purchased using $CMDC.</div></font><br>

	<br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><strong>1. Is it a currency or an asset?</strong><br>
	Both! $CMDC is the currency and tokens are the assets.</div></font>

	<br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><strong>2. If I purchase, can I sell?</strong>

	<br>

	Yes! If you decide to sell, you will receive the exact value in return as your original purchase.</div></font>

	<br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><strong>3. Will I lose money?</strong>

	<br>

	We do not consider money invested into purchasing $CMDC and token assets to be a loss.</div></font>

	<br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><strong>4. Where does the money go?</strong>

	<br>

	All funds received from $CMDC and token asset purchases are directed into a dedicated holding account.</div></font>

	<br>

	<font color="white"><div align="left" style="font-size:80%"><strong>5. Is it right for me?</strong>

	<br>

	Only you can decide! We are developing a stable and secure platform for a digital currency and asset class. 
	Like traditional stock market and cryptocurrency trading, the potential for financial loss is real and the
	liability for any loss(es) is the responsibility of the consumer.</div></font><br>
